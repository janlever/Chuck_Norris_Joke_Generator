      <p>
        I am a computer science student at Tallinn University. I am 22 years old
        and not getting any younger. In my free time I play basketball, which I
        have been doing for about 14 years now. This past semester I was on
        exchange, at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, studying Computer
        Science Engineering. Over there I would say I got some useful skills in
        programming and also got to meet a lot of cool people, who I still talk
        to.
